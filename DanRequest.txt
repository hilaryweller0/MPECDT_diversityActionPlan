Note to all CDTs: EPSRC thanks CDTs for their hard work in compiling their Equality and Diversity (E&D) data and comparing this with wider data available.  However, the Oversight Panel observed the lack of analysis beyond the raw data represented a missed opportunity, whilst relatively few CDTs discussed developing an Action Plan on E&D issues.  Going forward EPSRC therefore encourages all CDTs to develop an Action Plan on E&D, in line with EPSRC policy in this area (https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/equalitydiversity/) and should reflect the policy of the host institution(s).

The action plan should also contain an analysis of the raw data submitted as part of the Mid Term review (Sam please send Hilary and Simon a copy of the Mid-Term review document). We intend to incorporate your proposal in the Steering Committee meeting report and discuss it at the meeting. Please ensure that you send me proposal by Friday 24 November.

What is the diversity of your cohort against the four protected characteristics? How do these patterns compare to the ‘typical’ for the subject at your institution? How does this compare to the HESA-reported research population for the area(s)? (We are seeking aggregate information and not data on individuals). How much of the “student demand” have you fulfilled? 200 words

The CDT student body is 33% female, 3% over 30, 5% declared disabled and 8% BAME declared ethnicity.
The entire Mathematics PhD student body at Imperial is 19% female, 10% over 30, 4% declared disabled,
and 32% BAME; The Reading School of Mathematical, Physical and Computational Sciences PhD student
body is 36% female, 23% over 30, 10% declared disabled, and 21% BAME. HESA figures combine taught
and research postgraduates, reporting 46% female, 22% over 30, 6% declared disabled and 20% BAME.
Given our small sample size, we are very pleased to have recruited a large proportion of female students in
our 2015-16 and 2016-17 cohorts. Our female-male ratio is pulled down by our 2014-15 cohort which was
entirely male. Led by our Equality and Diversity Officers, we have strived hard to make an attractive
environment for female students, students with disabilities, students of different ages and students from
BAME groups. After reviewing our recruitment materials we observed a strong increase in female
applicants for the second and third cohorts. In our recruitment literature and on our website we include
positive images of our students from these groups, and we are careful to advertise accessibility of our
facilities during Open Days.

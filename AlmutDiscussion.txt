I was thinking of splitting the students into two groups of four students and have little group discussions on four diversity/equality questions (2 per group) and then write some answers on some self-stick notes on a mini poster and then swap the groups/questions.
The questions I have in mind are the following ones:
1) Recruiting for the CDT: Do you think that equality and diversity was promoted
during the recruitment process for the CDT? What was good? What was bad?
2) Your time at the CDT: Which activities have supported equality and diversity within the CDT?
3) Which activities would you like to see to increase equality and diversity in the CDT?
4) Have you experienced any inequality/lack of diversity within the CDT?

If you can think of any obvious omissions or any other questions we should discuss, please do let me know.

We can then have a final group discussion about the answers. If there are some Reading-based students, we could just have some Imperial-based and some Reading-based groups and have a joint discussion in the end. What dou you think of this plan?
